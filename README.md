# ESP8266PIR

Wireless (wifi) motion detector for Domoticz

My first project on github. I have a lot to discover here.

Scope of this project: <br>
Detect motion with a PIR. Send status wirelessly to Domoticz.<br>
Detector is battery operated, rechargeble. The case/holder will be printed on a 3D printer.<br>
